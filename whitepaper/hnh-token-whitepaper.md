# HashNHedge Token (HNH) Whitepaper v1.0

## Executive Summary

HashNHedge Token (HNH) is a utility token built on the Solana blockchain that powers the decentralized GPU computing ecosystem. HNH enables instant, low-cost payments for computational resources while incentivizing network participation through staking rewards and governance rights.

By tokenizing idle computing power, HNH creates a liquid marketplace where GPU owners earn passive income and clients access affordable computational resources for mining, AI training, and security operations.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Problem

The global computing infrastructure faces critical inefficiencies:

- **$67 billion** in idle GPU resources annually
- **73%** average idle time for consumer GPUs
- **300%** increase in cloud computing costs since 2020
- **Centralized control** by tech giants creating vendor lock-in
- **No liquid market** for computational resources

### 1.2 The Solution

HashNHedge Token creates a decentralized marketplace for computational resources where:

- GPU owners monetize idle hardware instantly
- Clients access computing power 70% cheaper than AWS/Azure
- Smart contracts ensure trustless, automatic payments
- Dynamic pricing optimizes resource allocation
- Token incentives align all stakeholder interests
